## RoboFriends

This is a React.js app that allows you to dynamically search through all of
your robot friends.

## What I learn from this project

* How to use `create-react-app`
* How to use `fetch` to get data from a Rest API.
* How to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) using the Lighthouse extension for Chrome
